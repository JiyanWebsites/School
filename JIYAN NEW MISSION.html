<p>Shubhanshu Shukla Axiom-4 Launch LIVE Updates: Shubhanshu Shukla was designated as astronaut number 634 by Commander Peggy Whitson in their first remarks aboard the International Space Station. Shukla expressed confidence about the experiments and other events planned for the next 14 days aboard the space laboratory. Earlier, the Axiom-4 Mission crew floated into the ISS through a hatch from the Crew Dragon Spacecraft.

What Shukla said: Earlier in the day, India’s Shubhanshu Shukla had greeted from space with a ‘Namaskar’. Shukla said he was “learning like a baby… how to walk and eat in space; this is a small step, but a steady and solid step towards India’s human space programme.” The Axiom-4 Mission is carrying Shukla and three other crew members to the ISS.

Difficult start: The mission had seen multiple delays since its initial schedule of May 29 due to various reasons, from problems in the launch vehicle and changes in pressure on ISS’ Zvezda module. The leak in Zvezda was first detected in 2019, and space agencies have been working for years to fix it. Repairs were carried out ahead of the Axiom-4 mission. The Dragon lifted off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 12.01 pm on Wednesday.</p>
